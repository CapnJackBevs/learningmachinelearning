# learningmachinelearning
This repository contains all my attempts of creating working machiene-learning code. This is purely for my own education so feel free to use any code, though be aware that much of it may not be my own, feel free to email me and ask. The projects here will be written in Python, Haskell and Rust, but possibly other languages also.
